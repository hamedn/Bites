Welcome to Bites! These Terms of Use (these "Terms" or the "Agreement") are important and govern your use and access of http://bitesapp.com/ (the “Web site”), the Bites mobile application (the “App”), and the services they provide, (together the “Services”). 

Bites App, Inc. d/b/a Bites (collectively "Bites", "We", or "Us") connects chefs on college campuses (each a "Chef") with users (collectively "Users") through an online platform (the "Services") that allows Chefs to post information about a meal or other culinary item (the "Meal") and allows users to order the meal from their mobile phone and pick them up at the Chef's designated location. Your access to and use of the Services are conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.

These Terms expressly supercede any prior terms or agreements between Bites and you as a User or as a Chef. Bites may change these agreements at any moment, without prior notice and for any or no reason. Bites may also modify and or ammend these terms at any moment. Your continued use of the Bites Application and or Website constitutes agreement with the most recent version of the Bites Terms. 

THE SERVICE CONSIST OF A MOBILE APPLICATION THROUGH WHICH CHEFS IN COLLEGES CAN POST MEALS THAT THEY ARE COOKING, AND USERS CAN READ THIS INFORMATION, PLACE AN ORDER, AND PICK UP THEIR MEAL FROM THE CHEF. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE BY USING THESE SERVICES THAT BITES DOES NOT PROVIDE FOOD SERVICES OR FUNCTION AS A RESTAURANT OR OTHERWISE ANY FORM OF BUSINESS THAT SELLS FOOD AND BEVERAGES. YOU RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT BITES IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, HAS NO CONTROL OVER, IS NOT PARTY TO, AND IS OTHERWISE NOT LIABLE IN ANY WAY FOR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN USERS AND CHEFS WITHIN THE BITES APPLICATION. 

CHEFS SHOULD UNDERSTAND HOW THE LAWS, RULES AND/ORREGULATIONS WORK IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES AND CITIES (COLLECTIVELY, "JURISDICTIONS").  SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS, RULES AND/ORREGULATIONS THAT MAY LIMIT A CHEF'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE MEALS AND/OR FOOD SERVICES.  THESE LAWS, RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS CAN BE PART OF A JURISDICTION'S ADMINISTRATIVE, AGRICULTURE AND/OR HEALTH CODES.  IN MANY JURISDICTIONS, CHEFS MUST REGISTER, GET A PERMIT, AND/OR OBTAIN A LICENSE BEFORE PROVIDING MEALS OR ENGAGING IN AND/OR PROVIDING THE SERVICES.  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT CHEFS FROM ENGAGING IN AND/OR PROVIDING THESE SERVICES ALTOGETHER.  STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VARY GREATLY IN HOW THEY ENFORCE THESE LAWS, RULES AND/OR REGULATIONS. PENALTIES MAY INCLUDE FINES OR OTHER ENFORCEMENT. CHEFS SHOULD REVIEW ALL STATE AND LOCAL LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS BEFORE USING THE SERVICES.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, BY ACCESSING OR USING THE WEB SITE, APP OR SERVICES OR BY DOWNLOADING OR POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM OR ON THE WEB SITE, VIA THE APPLICATION OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, AND THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE REGISTERED WITH THE SERVICE OR HAVE A BITES ACCOUNT.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, THEN YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCESS OR USE THE WEB SITE, APP AND SERVICES.

You acknowledge and agree that you alone are responsible for any and all Meals that you provide through the Web Site, App and Services.  Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Meal you post and any Meal provided by Chef via the Web Site, App and Services will be in compliance with all applicable laws, tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Meals listed or included via the Service, Web Site and App that you post (including having all required permits, licenses and registrations).  Please note that Bites assumes no responsibility for a Chef's compliance with any agreements with or duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations.   You acknowledge and agree that as a Chef you are responsible for your own acts and omissions.  Bites reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Meals posted for any reason, including Meal postings that Bites, in its sole discretion, considers objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Web Site, App or Services.

You must not impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity.

Bites makes a significant effort to require Chefs to describe each Meal accurately on our Services.  However, since the Meals are prepared by Chefs and not Bites, occasionally a Meal that you receive may not look or taste exactly how it was described or depicted to you.  You understand that this is normal, and you agree to accept such a Meal, regardless of variation from its description or depiction.  We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy of any description or depiction of any Meal.  We reserve the right to change or update any such description or depiction and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without giving you notice.

Bites does not endorse any Chef or Meal and Bites does not represent that a Meal is suitable or safe for your consumption.  By using the Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Member or other third parties who caused you harm.  You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from Bites with respect to such actions or omissions.

GENERAL DISCLAIMERS

Bites IS ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING THE WEB SITE, APP AND THE SERVICES UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  Bites SHALL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY MEALS THAT YOU ORDER THROUGH THE SERVICE.

ALL MEALS ARE PROVIDED BY CHEFS WHO USE OUR SERVICES.  Bites DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE QUALITY OF ANY CHEF OR MEAL. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING THE MEALS, THEIR CONTENTS AND/OR INGREDIENTS, AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ARE PREPARED AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR KNOWING ABOUT ANY FOOD ALLERGIES YOU MAY HAVE BEFORE HANDLING, USING OR CONSUMING SUCH MEALS.  Bites IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY ILLNESS OR OTHER RESULTS OR DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE CONSUMPTION OF ANY MEAL, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEATH, BODILY INJURY OR HEALTH PROBLEMS, OR ANY OTHER NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH ANY MEALS ORDERED THROUGH THE SERVICE. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING.

WE REQUIRE CHEFS TO DISPLAY THE MATERIALS, INGREDIENTS AND INFORMATION YOU VIEW ON OUR SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INGREDIENTS, AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF SUCH MATERIALS, INGREDIENTS AND INFORMATION AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OR RESULTING FROM YOUR RELIANCE THEREON. 

YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MEALS YOU RECEIVE IN YOUR ORDER MAY VARY FROM THE MATERIALS AND/OR INGREDIENTS DISPLAYED ON OUR SERVICES DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SYSTEM CAPABILITIES AND CONSTRAINTS OF YOUR MOBILE DEVICE, THE AVAILABILITY AND VARIABILITY OF MEALS AND/OR INGREDIENTS, DISTINCT COOKING OR OTHER PREPARATION METHODS USED BY THE CHEFS.  THE SERVICES MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT MEALS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN EVERY LOCATION.  A REFERENCE TO A MEAL ON OUR SERVICES DOES NOT IMPLY OR GUARANTEE THAT IT IS OR WILL BE AVAILABLE IN YOUR LOCATION AT THE TIME OF YOUR ORDER. 

ALL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.  Bites DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AS TO THE WEB SITE, APP, CONTENT, SERVICES, MATERIALS AND MEALS, ANY WARRANTIES THAT ARISE FROM TRADE USAGE OR CUSTOM, AND ANY WARRANTIES THAT THE WEBSITE, APP OR SERVICES WILL BE FREE AND CLEAR FROM ANY ADVERSE LIEN OR SECURITY INTERESTS.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM Bites, OR THROUGH THE WEB SITE, APP, CONTENT, SERVICES, MATERIALS OR MEAL, WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY MADE HEREIN.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; RELEASE

NEITHER Bites NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, PREPARING AND/OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES OR MEALS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, APP OR IN CONSUMPTION OF MEALS, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

IN NO EVENT WILL Bites'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, OR FROM ANY MEALS YOU HAVE RECEIVED EXCEED (I)  THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO Bites FOR USE OF OUR SERVICES OR (II) ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO Bites, AS APPLICABLE.

You should also note that if you knowingly make any material misrepresentation in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including, without limitation, costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.

LIMITATION ON TIME TO COMMENCE ACTION, JURISDICTION AND ARBITRATION

You agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to these Terms and our Services must commence by you within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, your ability to bring any case or cause or action against Bites shall be permanently barred.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the period during which Bites may bring any cause of action arising out of this Agreement against you.  These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of each party and its successors, assigns and agents. Bites may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates without giving you notice or to any other entity upon prior written notice to you.

Binding Arbitration. Any dispute or claim between you and Bites, arising out of, or relating in any way to, the Terms, the Services, or your use of the Services (“Dispute”) shall be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration. By virtue of this Agreement you and Bites are each giving up the right to go to court and have any Dispute heard by a judge or jury. 

The provisions of this Section shall constitute your and Bites's written agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act (“Agreement”). Any modification to this Agreement shall be in writing and signed by you and Bites. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to its rules, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879. The arbitrator will apply and be bound by this Agreement, apply applicable law and the facts, and issue a reasoned award.   Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.  All arbitrations are to be conducted in New York County, State of New York.

No Class Action Matters. You and Bites expressly agree that each shall bring any dispute, in any amount, against the other, in each other’s respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that all disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.

These Terms, your access to and use of the Services shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

SEVERABILITY

If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.

MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Bites relating to your access to and use of our Services. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Bites. No waiver of any provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or subsequent circumstance, and Bites's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.
